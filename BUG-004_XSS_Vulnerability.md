- **Browser:** Chrome 120.0
- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **Screen Resolution:** 1920x1080
- **Device:** Desktop
- **Test Data Used:** Contact Name: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

---

## Severity
- [x] Critical - Security vulnerability, potential security breach

---

## Priority
- [x] P1 - Fix immediately (Critical severity)

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to https://www.demoblaze.com/
2. Click on "Contact" link
3. Enter Contact Email: "test@example.com"
4. Enter Contact Name: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
5. Enter Message: "Test message"
6. Click "Send message" button
7. Observe the behavior

**Prerequisites:** None

---

## Expected Result
XSS payload should be sanitized or blocked. Script should not execute. Input should be treated as plain text or rejected with validation error.

---

## Actual Result
JavaScript alert with message "XSS" is displayed, indicating that the script is being executed. This confirms XSS vulnerability. The malicious script is not sanitized before being processed or displayed.

## Test Case Reference
**Related Test Case:** TC-SEC-001  
**Related Requirement:** NFR-3

---

## Suggested Fix / Root Cause Analysis
The application is not sanitizing user input before processing or displaying it. The XSS payload is being executed because the input is not being escaped or validated. This is a critical security vulnerability that could allow attackers to execute malicious scripts.

**Suggested Fix:**
1. Implement input sanitization for all user inputs
2. Escape HTML special characters (<, >, &, ", ')
3. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
4. Validate and sanitize input on both client and server side
5. Use framework-specific sanitization libraries
6. Perform security code review
7. Test all input fields for XSS vulnerabilities

**Security Impact:**
- Attackers could steal user session cookies
- Attackers could redirect users to malicious sites
- Attackers could deface the website
- Attackers could steal sensitive user data

## Additional Notes
This is a critical security vulnerability that must be fixed immediately. All input fields should be tested for XSS vulnerabilities. This was discovered during security testing as part of non-functional testing.

**Recommendation:** Conduct comprehensive security audit of all input fields and implement proper input sanitization across the application.
